# Weather App - Class Project

## Overview

This project was created for an assignment in CTEC 126 JavaScript at Clark College in the Spring quarter of 2003, as part of the unit covering APIs. We were asked to use the API from Open Weather to create a page that displayed both the current weather and an extended 5 day forecast.

I gave myself an additional goal to make the animations on the page as smooth as possible. I achieved this through a combination of timing adjustments in CSS on the transitions, as well as the use of timers in JavaScript. I also wanted to use relatively large icons for the weather indicator, but those provided by Open Weather are quite small, so I created custom artwork to match the design I created.

## Assignment Requirements

- Review the weather.js code that has been provided. The code for the getCurrentWeather() function is complete and works. However, you must make the forecast appear differently than what has been provided.
- You must comment all of the JavaScript code that you develop.
- You should also use the code to help you develop new code for the getWeatherForecast() function.
- You must develop additional code to show data for the current weather and the forecasted weather to include the following data:
  - Low temperature
  - High temperature
  - Humidity
  - Feels Like
  - Wind Speed
- The 5 day forecast must be displayed and its listener must call the getWeatherForecast() function. Again, this code will be very similar to the code provided for the current weather.
- You must also add 2 other data points of your choice to both the getCurrentWeather() and getWeatherForecast() functions.
- You must change the CSS to make the page professional looking and visually appealing
- Your page must pass all WAVE tests. This means no alerts, errors or contrast errors.
- Your page must also pass HTML and CSS Validation
